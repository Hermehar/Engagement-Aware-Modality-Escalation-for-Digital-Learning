
# Engagement Aware Modality Escalation for Digital Learning

A multi-modal digital learning assistant that combines real-time engagement detection with intelligent content retrieval and dialogue. This project demonstrates how webcam-based student engagement sensing can be paired with an LLM-powered learning companion to dynamically support learners of sorting algorithms.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository implements an engagement-aware digital learning system that:
- Detects student engagement in real time using webcam video and a YOLO-based model pipeline.
- Provides a Streamlit chatbot interface powered by Google Gemini (`gemini-2.0-flash`).
- Uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for contextual answers from educational content.
- Supports text, image, and video learning modalities for algorithm education.

## � Study Design & Evaluation

This project also reflects a controlled user study comparing two instructional conditions:

- **Adaptive condition**: a dynamic interface escalates instructional modality from text to image to video when disengagement is detected.
- **Static condition**: a conventional text-only interface delivers identical educational content without modality changes.

### Learning task

- Participants studied seven sorting algorithms: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Heap, and Radix Sort.
- Each module began with text explanations and steps, with images and videos introduced in the adaptive condition only.

### Engagement inference

- The system captures visual behavioral cues through a webcam and estimates learner engagement in real time.
- A lightweight YOLOv8n model was fine-tuned on student engagement data to trigger modality escalation.
- The detection pipeline is used to adapt instruction rather than to evaluate perception accuracy.

### Participants and measures

- 20 university students participated in the study (10 dynamic, 10 static).
- Measures included NASA-TLX cognitive workload dimensions, user experience questionnaire ratings, and qualitative feedback.

### Key findings

- Adaptive modality escalation reduced mental demand, effort, and frustration compared to static text-only delivery.
- Participants reported higher engagement, satisfaction, and concentration with the adaptive interface.
- Adaptive modality changes were generally perceived as helpful rather than distracting.
- Reported limitations focused on responsiveness and smoother disengagement detection.

## �📌 Recommended Enhancements

- Add more algorithm topics and video resources
- Improve engagement prediction robustness with additional training data
- Expand modality escalation logic for adaptive interventions
- Add user authentication and session logging for classroom evaluation
